# Tailwind CSS Generator

## About 
Tailwind CSS Generator is a simple SAAS application <br/>
that I am building. I am building it so that I can <br/>
understand Tailwind better and improve my programming skills. 

## Stack Used 
The stack is simple 
<ul>
  <li>Svelte</li>
  <li>Vite</li>
  <li>Github Pages</li>
</ul>

### Why use Svelte?
1. Wanted to understand a different way to develop an application,<br/>
so that I can improve my programming skills.
2. Svelte is also a fast framework, as it is lightweight.
